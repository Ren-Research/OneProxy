## Hardware-aware NAS Dilemma

CNNs are used in numerous real-world applications such as vision-based autonomous driving and video content analysis. To run CNN inference on various target devices, hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) is crucial. A key requirement of efficient hardware-aware NAS is the fast evaluation of inference latencies in order to rank different architectures. While building a latency predictor for each target device has been commonly used in state of the art, this is a very time-consuming process, lacking scalability in the presence of extremely diverse devices.

## Our approach: exploiting latency monotonicity

We address the scalability challenge by exploiting latency monotonicity ‚Äî the architecture latency rankings on different devices are often correlated. When strong latency monotonicity exists, we can re-use architectures searched for one proxy device on new target devices, without losing optimality.

### Using SRCC to measure latency monotonicity

To quantify the degree of latency monotonicity, we use the metric of Spearman‚Äôs Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC), which lies between -1 and 1 and assesses statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables using a monotonic function. The greater the SRCC of CNN latencies on two devices, the better the latency monotonicity. SRCC of 0.9 to 1.0 is usually viewed as strongly dependent in terms of monotonicity.

We empirically show the existence of strong latency monotonicity among devices of the same platform, including mobile, FPGA, desktop GPU and CPU.

## In the absence of strong latency monotonicity: adapting the proxy latency predictor

### AdaProxy for boosting latency monotonicity

We exploit the correlation among devices and propose efficient transfer learning to boost the otherwise possibly weak latency monotonicity for a target device.
